In the case of a chain store, it may be all of the actual shops. For mail order companies, the location will usually be the headquarter of the Business Entity.\n\nLocations of Sales or Service Provisioning are characterized by an address or geographical position and a set of opening hour specifications for various days of the week.\n\nExample: A rental car company may offer the Business Function Lease Out of cars from two locations, one in Fort Myers, Florida, and one in Boston, Massachussetts. Both stations are open 7:00 - 23:00 Mondays through Saturdays.\n\nNote:  Typical address standards (vcard) and location data should be attached to a Location of Sales or Service Provisioning. Since there already exist established vocabularies for this, the GoodRelations ontology does not provide respective attributes. Instead, the use of respective vocabularies is recommended. However, the hasGlobalLocationNumber property is  provided for linking to respective identifiers for business locations."@en ,

	rdfs:comment	"A location is a point or area of interest from which a particular product or service is available, e.g. a store, a bus stop, a gas station, or a ticket booth. The difference to gr:BusinessEntity is that the gr:BusinessEntity is the legal entity (e.g. a person or corporation) making the offer, while gr:Location is the store, office, or place. A chain restaurant will e.g. have one legal entity but multiple restaurant locations. Locations are characterized by an address or geographical position and a set of opening hour specifications for various days of the week.\n\t\t\nExample: A rental car company may offer the Business Function Lease Out of cars from two locations, one in Fort Myers, Florida, and one in Boston, Massachussetts. Both stations are open 7:00 - 23:00 Mondays through Saturdays.\n\nNote: Typical address standards (vcard) and location data (geo, WGC84) should be attached to a gr:Location node. Since there already exist established vocabularies for this, the GoodRelations ontology does not provide respective attributes. Instead, the use of respective vocabularies is recommended. However, the gr:hasGlobalLocationNumber property is  provided for linking to public identifiers for business locations.\n\t\t\nCompatibility with schema.org: This class is equivalent to http://schema.org/Place."@en ;
