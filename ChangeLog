	the same function which allows to drop some code.

2015-02-10  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	We do not need that since we parse a file in one
	go.

2015-02-10  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Show an error when trying to parse non-ttl ontology sources.

	Since we are using the N3.js parser we can only

	Removed deprecated code.

	re-render the contents if necessary.

2015-02-08  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Do not always rebuild the entity table after showing the editor.

	Instead we simply update the entity list.

2015-02-08  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	New function EntityView.updateEntity.

	It allows to update a single entity in the view. We will use this
	to update the view after having edited an entity.

2015-02-08  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	New Bootstrap-table function: update.

	This function updates a single data object by referencing it
	via a given field rather than the row index.

2015-02-07  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	New function Document.getEntity.

	same format at listEntities does.

2015-02-07  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Improved version of Document.listEntities.

	This version simply iterates over all triples and extracts

	Major code simplification in Document.deleteBySubject|Object

	Instead of doing a select query and then converting the results
	into triples, we do a construct and directly get the triples we need.
	In addition this actually makes it work rather than crash in rdfstore
	with some OID error.

2015-02-06  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Added default value for autoInverseOfHandling into config.js.

	BCE restriction: olo:item has cardinality 1.

2015-02-06  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Backbone-Forms list: Fix handling of nested lists.

	We need to make sure our event handlers only apply to the main list,

2015-02-05  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Added missing label for bceui:TouchpointFilter.

	Support range rdfs:Class and rdf:Property when presenting choices.

	- the lens contains fresnel:allProperties
	- or there is no lens.

2015-02-05  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Disable trimOnSearch in the bootstrap table. Stupid feature.

	Nested models: only create data if there are triples to be added.

2015-02-05  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	HACK in ontology manager to avoid long graph urls.

	When using /sparql urls to get individuals or other data
	in the ontology manager, then the graph uris can become very
	long. We now use a fixed graph uri, avoiding that problem.
	This, however, is no long-term solution and should be
	improved.

2015-02-05  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Removed unused function.

2015-02-05  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Moved BCE-specific ontologies and templates into bce/ subdir

2015-02-05  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	with a preselected type.

2015-02-05  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Merge branch 'feature/uniqueRestriction' into develop

2015-02-05  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Moved getUniqueValue from OntologyClass into Document.

	The unique value is specific to the document, not the class. Thus, the
	logical place for the function is Document.

2015-02-05  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

2015-02-04  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Code cleanup.

	- One does not check for a config flag in a function like Document.inverseTriple
	  instead this is done in the functions like addTriple.
	- Removed some clutter in the code.

2015-02-04  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Merge branch 'feature/simpleEditorPage' into develop

2015-02-02  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Merge branch 'feature/moveStuffIntoRDFE.Editor' into develop

2015-02-02  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Use events instead of callbacks for time-consuming editor tasks.

	Some of the actions in the RDFE.Editor can be trigered by user
	interaction. Now with using events instead of "finished" callbacks
	the client will always be informed about these actions.

2015-02-02  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Made the editor more self-contained.

	The container element is now set once. After that the
	editor renders all its components into this one copntainer.

2015-01-29  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Added poor-man's inference for resource-type check.

	If the resource does not have a type defined, we simply check its
	properties for domains and combine them all into a list.
	That way we can find a template for a resource even if it does not
	have a type.

2015-01-29  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Avoid null-pointer ex.

	Move "add property" action to the top of the entity editor (Bug 16586)

	reason a non-cloned (ie. one appended in OntologyProperty.parse) property
	 in OntologyClass.properties would not always carry the correct
	restriction values.

2015-01-27  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Fixed aggregate editing and creation.

	- Aggregates are also managed as lists
	- We use a custom nested model editor which properly handles our model
	- We create an entity uri if the aggregate resource does not exist
	- We save all aggregate triples along with the main resources'

2015-01-27  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Always put the type first in entity editors without lens.

	Let Document.Model use the ontology manager from the Document.

	Use a fallback name for entity uri creation if none is given.

	Custom Backbone.Form which has a button to add a new property.

	Do not use empty label values.

	Clone the lens properties into the model to avoid changes later on.

2015-01-27  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	The Backbone entity model now has a field "types".

	This allows to clean up the API for simpler use in the future.

	If a template is specififed the user does not have to enter the uri of
	a new entity. Instead they enter the name which is used to build the
	uri from the template.

2015-01-26  Sebastian Trueg  <trueg@openlinksw.com>

	Added entityUriTmpl config value and simplified config options building.

	Fixed error handling in ontologyParse.

	Added missing js file.
